# Assemble the Full Receiver

## Task
Decode an RRC-shaped QPSK frame. Given: 8000 Hz, 8 sps, roll-off 0.35. Timing, CFO, and phase require correction.

The supplied artifact is `capture.iq`. Write only the requested value or decoded
plaintext to `answer.txt`, with no labels or quotation marks.

IQ format is little-endian interleaved float32: I0,Q0,I1,Q1,...
Every radio frame ultimately contains either AA AA AA AA + length + plaintext,
or fictional LumaLink frames: D3 91 + length + payload + CRC-16/CCITT-FALSE.
Use plots only as diagnostics; a script should produce the final answer.

Workflow:
1. Run `./run`.
2. Write a small Python analysis and inspect intermediate measurements.
3. Put the final result in `answer.txt`.
4. Run `./check`.
